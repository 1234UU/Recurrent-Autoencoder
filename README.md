Recurrent-Autoencoder
=====================
This program is an auto-encoder with RNN. It is a kind of unsupervised learning, what we want is the latent vector produced by the encoder. We can use it to transform a variational length sequence into a fixed length vector. Specifically, we want to do that for SMILES code which is a chemical expression of molecules.
